Functions to access native colors on the target platform by supplying the native colorâ€™s corresponding value.

## Ios

### Ios.get

`Ios.get` is used to get color information from UI Element Colors.

```rescript
get: Ios.t => Color.t
```

#### Ios.get{n}

Methods to send fallbacks.

## Android

See: [UI Element Colors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/ui_element_colors)

### Android.getAttr

`Android.getAttr` is used to get color information from android attributes.

```rescript
getAttr: Android.t => Color.t
```

See: [R.attr](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr)

### Android.getColor

`Android.getColor` is used to get color information from android colors.

```rescript
getColor: Android.t => Color.t
```

See: [R.color](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.color)

### Android.get

Allow to get color or attr.

#### Android.get{n}

You may want to get multiple platform colors in case one is not supported by the system. In this case, you can use the `get{n}` function to retrieve the values. You can mix and match Android color and attributes in this call. The first value will be treated as default and rest will be treated as fallback.

Defined up to 7 arguments.

## unsafeGet

Depending on platform & OS version (and for Android you can have user-defined attrs for colors), this function is used for getting platform colors from strings.

```rescript
unsafeGet: string => Color.t
```

### unsafeGet{n}

The unsafe version of `get{n}` where a string can be passed in. This can be any Android resource query, for example: `?attr/colorPrimary` or `?android:attr/colorPrimary`, even resources defined within your Android app. The first value will be treated as default and rest will be treated as fallback.

Defined up to 7 arguments.

### unsafeGetMultiple

The array version of `unsafeGet{n}` supporting arbitrary number of fallbacks.

```rescript
unsafeGetMultiple: array(string) => Color.t
```

## Example

```rescript
open ReactNative
let styles = {
  open Style
  StyleSheet.create({
    "container": style(
      ~color=switch Platform.os {
      | os if os == Platform.android =>
        PlatformColor.Android.get2(#primary_text_dark, #colorPrimary)
      | os if os == Platform.ios => PlatformColor.Ios.get(#label)
      | _ => "black"
      },
    ),
  })
}
```
